## Abstract

Named entity recognition and normalization are crucial tasks for information extraction in the medical field. They have been tackled through different approaches from rule-based systems and classic machine learning methods with feature engineering to the most sophisticated deep learning models, but most of the time for English. In this work, we present a transfer learning approach started from multilingual BERT to face the problem of Spanish NER in clinical cases by applying a paragraph tuning strategy and simple post-processing in the inference phase. Our system achieved an F1 of 0.8499 in the testing dataset of the LivingNER shared task 2022.
